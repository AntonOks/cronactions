# cronactions [say "cron" + "actions"]
This repo will host some scripts, which I usually run very often, say every day __OR__ just GitHub things, which I want to be automated.

## Why this repo?
Well... the real reason is, I had already some "Actions" scripts running in various GitHub repos, but most of the time, it'sa not worth to keep the plenty genarated logs for a longer time. And instead of having other scripts, deleting the unneeded logs / artifacts, I'm going to centralize those Actins in thei repo, which is configured to keep only 3 days af logs and artifacts. That it...
